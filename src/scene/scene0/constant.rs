  "Who am I?\n--------------------------------\nHi, I am sabbir. I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am very hardworking and dedicated to my work.

Bangladesh is a densely populated excessively green country.\n We have 12 Gregorian calendar months (as you have known), 2 bengali months which are \"Falgun\" and \"Baishakh\", 2 arabic months which are \"Ramadan\" and \"Dhu\'l-Hijjah\".\n We have 3 sessions which are hot, rainy and not so hot session.",

  "My Aim in LIFE\n--------------------------------\n One day, Lord Krishna was returning to his kingdom. All the villagers were meticulously decorating their homes and roads, so that their God's Ratha Yatra (chariot procession) would look more resplendent.\nBut some villagers intentionally kept their homes and roads completely in darkness.\nNaturally, Krishna asked them why they had chosen to do that.\nThey replied, \"Dear God, your Ratha Yatra is already so bright. We realized that if we remained in darkness, your glorious procession would shine much more brilliantly.\"\nI wish I could be like those villagers.",

  "My Nightmare\n--------------------------------\n  As a software engineer, the thing I'm most afraid of is the dreaded \"500: Internal Server Error.\"\n But my absolute worst nightmare is when someone finds out what I do and asks me: \"So you are a software engineer, can you fix my smartphone or computer?\" I\'m still working on how to reply to that one, though.\"\n My Day-dream\n--------------------------------\n One day, I will arrive at the office on time, write code all day without a single test, successfully deploy it directly to production without a bug, and head back home on time for a sound sleep.\n And yes, I know this is never going to happen.\n",

  "Hobbies\n--------------------------------\nI love reading books and have a deep interest in mythology and history.\n My favorite writers are Maupassant and Mirza Ghalib.\n My favorite book is Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. The book I've read the most but never finished is the English-to-Bengali Dictionary. And the books that truly make me cry are my checkbooksâ€”and that might be because of my own cache issues\n \n Social Life\n--------------------------------\n I don't post on social media regularly. but regularly, I try to do a git commit."
