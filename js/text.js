  My Nightmare\n -----------------------\n
  As a software engineer, My worst nightmare is that, one day someone told me, "So you are software engineer, can you fix my smartphone/computer?"\n 
  My Day-dream\n -----------------------\n
  My day dream, one day I arrived at office on time, write code all day without any testing, run code successfully on production environment with no bug and go back to home and take a sound sleep.\n And I also know it will never happen.

 Where I live?\n -----------------------\n
 I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n
 Do you know where is Bangladesh? Well If you ever buy a map of India, you will get a  free Bangladesh's map.\n
 Do not think we are cheep. We are very brave. Bangladesh is one of two countries in world after USA, who have earned their indipendence through liberation war in mordern history.

  I wanted to be HERCULES, but I'm not that strong\n
 Wanted to be ALEXANDER-THE-GREAT, but I am not the chosen one\n
 Wanted to be DIONYSUS, But I am not that good\n
 Wanted to be HEROSTRATUS, but I am not that bad\n
 Wanted to be LEONARDO DA VINCI, wanted to draw MONA LISA. I really wish I could\n 
  Wanted to be NIKOLA TESLA, But it is beyond my limit\n
 Wanted to be Ashutosh, but I am not that fortunate\n

  So what am I now?\n
 I am DON QUIXOTE of LA MANCHA. I can't afford SANCHO PANZA, But I have ROCINANTE and DULCINEA-DEL-TOBOSO.
