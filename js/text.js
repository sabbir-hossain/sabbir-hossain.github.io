  My nightmare
    As a software engineer, My worst nightmare is that, one day someone told me, "So you are software engineer, can you fix my smartphone/computer?"\n 
  My Day-dream
    My day dream, one day I arrived at office on time, write code all day without test, run code successfully on production environment with no bug and go back to home and take a sound sleep.\n And I also know it will never happen.
