 Where I live?\n -----------------------\n
 I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n
 Do you know where Bangladesh is? Well, you will receive a free map of Bangladesh if you ever buy a map of India.\n
 Do not think we are cheep. We are quite brave. Bangladesh is one of two nations after the USA in the world that won the liberation war in modern history and has gained its independence.\n
 Some information about my country is given here. Bangladesh is a densely populated excessively green country. We have 12 Gregorian calendar months (as you have known), 2 bengali months which are "Falgun" and "Baishakh", 2 arabic months which are "Ramadan" and "Dhu'l-Hijjah".

 Wanted to be ALEXANDER-THE-GREAT, but I am not the one selected\n
 Wanted to be DIOGENES, But I am not that good at that\n
 Wanted to be HEROSTRATUS, but I am not that bad
  Wanted to be LEONARDO DA VINCI, wanted to build MONA LISA. I really wish I could
  Wanted to be NIKOLA TESLA, But it is beyond my limits
 Wanted to be Ashutosh, but I am not that lucky\n

  So what am I?\n
 I am DON QUIXOTE of LA MANCHA.\n
 What will I be?
  I will be like Lao Tzu

  My Aim in LIFE\n -----------------------\n
  One Day, God KRISHNA was returning to his kingdom. All of the villagers enlighten their homes and roads so that their GOD's "Ratha Yatra" would looked wonderful.\n
  But some villagers made their homes and roads completely into darkness.\n
  Then LORD KRISHNA asked them why did they do that?\n
  They said that dear GOD your "Ratha Yatra" is already in enlighten, so we found out that if we would be into darkness, your "Ratha Yatra" will looked much more wonderful.\n
  I wish I would be like those villagers.

  My Nightmare\n -----------------------\n
  As a software engineer, the thing that I afraid most is "500: Internal Server Error". But my worst nightmare is that, one day someone tell me, "So you are software engineer, can you fix my smartphone or computer? I'm working on it, though."\n 
  My Day-dream\n -----------------------\n
  One day I will arrive at office on time, write code all day without any testing, run code successfully on production environment without a bug and go back to home on time as well as take a sound sleep.\n And I also know this is never going to happen.
