 I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n
 Do you know where Bangladesh is? Well, you will receive a free map of Bangladesh if you ever buy a map of India.
 Do not think we are cheap. We are quite brave. Bangladesh is one of two nations after the USA in the world who gained its independence by winning the liberation war.
 Some information about my country is given here. Bangladesh is a densely populated excessively green country. 
 We have 12 Gregorian calendar months (as you have known), 2 bengali months which are "Falgun" and "Baishakh", 2 arabic months which are "Ramadan" and "Dhu'l-Hijjah". 
 We have 3 sessions which are hot, rainy and not so hot session.

  I wanted to be HERCULES, but I'm not that strong\n
 Wanted to be ALEXANDER-THE-GREAT, but I was not the one chosen\n
 Wanted to be DIOGENES, but I am not that good\n
 Wanted to be HEROSTRATUS, but thankfully, I am not that bad
  Wanted to be LEONARDO DA VINCI, wanted to build MONALISA. I truly wish I could
  Wanted to be NIKOLA TESLA, but that brilliance is beyond my limits
 Wanted to be Ashutosh,  but I am simply not that lucky\n

  So what am I?\n
 I am DON QUIXOTE of LA MANCHA.\n
 What will I be?
  I will be Lao Tzu

  One day, Krishna was returning to his kingdom. All the villagers were meticulously decorating their homes and roads so that their God's Ratha Yatra (chariot procession) would look more resplendent.\n

  But some villagers intentionally kept their homes and roads completely in darkness.\n

  Naturally, Krishna asked them why they had chosen to do that.\n

  They replied, "Dear God, your Ratha Yatra is already so bright. We realized that if we remained in darkness, your glorious procession would shine much more brilliantly.\n

  I wish I could be like those villagers.

    text: `My Nightmare\n -----------------------\n
  As a software engineer, the thing I'm most afraid of is the dreaded "500: Internal Server Error.\n 

But my absolute worst nightmare is when someone finds out what I do and asks me: "So you're a software engineer, can you fix my smartphone or computer?" I'm still working on how to reply to that one, though."\n 


  My Day-dream\n -----------------------\n
  One day, I will arrive at the office on time, write code all day without a single test, successfully deploy it directly to production without a bug, and head back home on time for a sound sleep.\n

And yes, I know this is never going to happen.\n

    text: `Hobbies\n -----------------------\n
  I love reading books and have a deep interest in mythology and history.\n

My favorite writers are Maupassant and Mirza Ghalib.\n

My favorite book is Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. The book I've read the most but never finished is the English-to-Bengali Dictionary. And the books that truly make me cry are my checkbooksâ€”and that might be because of my own cache issues\n
  \n
 Social Life\n -----------------------\n
 I don't post on social media regularly, but almost every day, I do a git commit.
